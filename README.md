# An ImageEditor
This is implemented in python. This can do basic tasks like increase brightness, change saturation, depixelize etc.. Still, effects like blurring, sharening has to be done.
Thinking to implement this on verilog, where image is coverted to values, manipulated on hardware and reconstruction of image. Python will be used for reconstruction.
